# Analyzing-Regional-Poverty-in-NorthKorea-Using-Nightlights-replication
The purpose of this repository is to visualize the work of Jesús Crespo Cuaresma(2020) and 김다울(2021) using R. The project is based on the work of FABI BRU on different setting.
The goal of the paper is to use satellite imagery and nightlights data to predict poverty levels at a local level in North Korea. 

## Introduction
Obtaining any quantitative information on the North Korean economy is notoriously difficult. However, the availability of satellite data on night-time light emissions and other observable terrain characteristics has opened new possibilities in terms of understanding and visualizing socioeconomic developments in North Korea. The analysis uses night-time light emission data from 2004 to 2013 to estimate income and poverty in North Korea at the subnational level.

## Data Sources
These are sources where I got the data from:

1. Country shape file: gadm.org
2. Night Light Values : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fbruckschen/nightlights
  (Night light observations as seen from space for all over the world. Spans the years 2004 until including 2013. One .tif file per year.)
